# Projects

A collection of programming languages and tools I've built.

## Programming Languages

### [Lea](/docs/lea)

A pipe-oriented functional programming language with a tree-walk interpreter written in TypeScript. Lea emphasizes left-to-right data flow using pipes, making functional composition intuitive and readable.

### [Vague](/docs/vague)

A constraint and probability-based programming language for describing and generating realistic data. Vague treats ambiguity as a first-class primitive, combining schema definition with probabilistic data generation.

## Developer Tools

### [OMG](/docs/omg)

OAS Markdown Grammar - a human-first domain-specific language for API specification. OMG transforms verbose OpenAPI specs into readable Markdown, reducing typical specifications by ~6x in line count.

## Documentation Tooling

Docusaurus plugins for enhancing documentation sites.

### [docusaurus-plugin-banner](https://github.com/mcclowes/docusaurus-plugin-banner)

A customizable, dismissible banner plugin for Docusaurus v3 sites with localStorage persistence. Supports HTML content, multiple banner instances, and smooth animations.

### [docusaurus-plugin-cookie-consent](https://github.com/mcclowes/docusaurus-plugin-cookie-consent)

A GDPR-compliant cookie consent modal for Docusaurus with configurable categories, Google Consent Mode v2 integration, and React hooks for conditional script loading.

### [docusaurus-plugin-glossary](https://github.com/mcclowes/docusaurus-plugin-glossary)

Comprehensive glossary functionality with auto-generated pages, searchable terms, and inline tooltips. Includes a remark plugin for automatic term detection in markdown.

### [docusaurus-plugin-statuspage](https://github.com/mcclowes/docusaurus-plugin-statuspage)

Displays a dismissible banner when your Statuspage.io reports incidents or degraded service. Fetches status automatically and persists dismissals per incident.

### [docusaurus-post-notifications](https://github.com/mcclowes/docusaurus-post-notifications)

Shows toast notifications for new blog posts based on the user's last visit. Works client-side with localStorage, supports multiple toasts, and respects user preferences.

### [docusaurus-plugin-starter](https://github.com/mcclowes/docusaurus-plugin-starter)

A batteries-included template for building Docusaurus plugins. Includes typed plugin skeleton, client/theme wiring, remark integration, example site, and test setup.
