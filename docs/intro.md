# Projects

A collection of programming languages and tools I've built.

## Programming Languages

### [Lea](/docs/lea)

A pipe-oriented functional programming language with a tree-walk interpreter written in TypeScript. Lea emphasizes left-to-right data flow using pipes, making functional composition intuitive and readable.

### [Vague](/docs/vague)

A constraint and probability-based programming language for describing and generating realistic data. Vague treats ambiguity as a first-class primitive, combining schema definition with probabilistic data generation.

## Developer Tools

### [OMG](/docs/omg)

OAS Markdown Grammar - a human-first domain-specific language for API specification. OMG transforms verbose OpenAPI specs into readable Markdown, reducing typical specifications by ~6x in line count.
