At some point I started treating reading as self-improvement. Every book had to teach me something. I'm trying to undo that.

## The productivity trap

Reading became another form of work. Non-fiction that would make me better at my job. Books recommended by successful people. Reading lists optimised for learning.

I was consuming books, not enjoying them.

## What got lost

Reading for pleasure is different. You follow curiosity rather than optimising for outcomes. You read slowly when you want to. You abandon books without guilt. You re-read favourites.

The point is the experience, not the takeaway.

## The false dichotomy

Of course, fun reading teaches you things too. Fiction develops empathy and imagination. Poetry changes how you see language. Even "escapist" reading has value.

But framing everything as learning makes reading feel like work. The joy drains out.

## Recovering pleasure

I'm trying to:
- Read more fiction
- Stop tracking books as achievements
- Re-read things I loved
- Let myself quit books freely
- Read things with no "practical" value

It's harder than it sounds. The productivity mindset runs deep.

## Why it matters

If reading is always work, eventually you stop reading. Or you keep reading but lose the thing that made you love it in the first place.

Reading for fun isn't a waste of time. It's the original point.
