Religious traditions have always emphasised self-restraint. Modern society has systematically dismantled it.

I'm not religious. But I've come to think that religious frameworks understood something important about human psychology that secular modernity has forgotten: we need guardrails against our own impulses.

Fasting. Sabbath. Temperance. These weren't arbitrary rules - they were technologies for managing human weakness.

Now we have algorithms optimised to maximise engagement with our base urges. Infinite scroll. Autoplay. Notifications engineered to trigger dopamine hits. The entire attention economy is built on exploiting our inability to resist.

We've replaced external constraints with permission to indulge. "You deserve it." "Treat yourself." "Follow your passion."

The result is an epidemic of anxiety, addiction, and distraction. We're overwhelmed by choice and paralysed by optionality. The freedom to do anything has become the inability to do anything well.

I'm not advocating a return to religion. But I wonder if we need to rebuild some of those constraints - whether through technology, habit design, or cultural norms.

Self-restraint isn't oppression. It's what makes sustained focus, deep relationships, and meaningful work possible.
