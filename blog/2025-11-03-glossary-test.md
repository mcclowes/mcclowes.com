This is a test post to verify that the glossary auto-import is working correctly.

## Testing Glossary Terms

This blog post mentions several technical terms that should be automatically linked to the glossary:

- **API** - Application Programming Interface is fundamental to modern development
- **REST** - RESTful APIs are very common
- **GraphQL** - GraphQL is an alternative to REST
- **SDK** - Software Development Kits help developers
- **HTTP** and **HTTPS** - Secure protocols for the web
- **JSON** - JavaScript Object Notation for data exchange
- **CLI** - Command Line Interface tools
- **DevOps** - Development and Operations practices
- **CI/CD** - Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment
- **Docusaurus** - The framework powering this site

If auto-import is working, all of these terms should be automatically linked without any manual import statements.
