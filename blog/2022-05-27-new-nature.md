Trees are still trees here.

People seem to recognise
their natural value,
but all else is made.

Our promethean benefactors
have gifted us
such wondrous creations as
Tesco Expresses,
alike as SpartacÄ«.

Gifts like:
homes;
roads, that we might go between homes;
traffic lights, that we might pause for a time along the journey;
speeding tickets, that me might go more softly to the end.

And despite these crafted urbanities
we long for the organic?

To roam earthen paths
slowly
amongst old nature.
