I have tried every way of writing dates for files, notes, and folders. The best I have found is `YYMMDD`.

<!--truncate-->

## Why it wins

- **Alphabetising equals chronology**: `180915`, `181001`, `181201` will sort in the correct order in any file browser, search result, or text list.
- **Compact, fixed width**: Six digits are quick to type, easy to scan, and align neatly.
- **Locale neutral**: Avoids `DD/MM/YY` vs `MM/DD/YY` confusion.
- **Great for prefixes**: Put the date at the start, then a hyphen, then your title. Your lists stay clean and chronological.

## When to use YYYYMMDD

If the century could be ambiguous (legal docs, historical records, or anything that might outlive you), use `YYYYMMDD`.

- Example (short‑lived notes, clear context): `180915-trip-ideas.md`
- Example (long‑lived, century matters): `20180915-contract-signed.pdf`

## Alternatives are worse

- **`DD/MM/YY` or `MM-DD-YY`** - Ambiguous, inconsistent in standards, and they sort incorrectly.
- **`MM-DD-YY`** is also non chronological.
- **Month names** - Human-friendly, but hard to scan and sort (`15 Sep 2018` vs `Sep 15, 2018`).

## Simple rule

Start every filename with `YYMMDD-`. If the century matters, upgrade to `YYYYMMDD-`. That is it.
