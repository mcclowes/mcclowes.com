Life is in children raised and grandchildren cherished.  
A warm smile greeting missed family at the door with  
Countless conversations, accidental catchphrases,  
And inevitable farewells.  
  
<!--truncate-->  
  
It is in bird song,  
Completing a well-tended garden  
Enjoyed from a kitchen window.  
  
Life is in celebration and passion,  
Music made, art formed,  
Achievements and regrets  
treasured equally.  
  
It is in mundane routine unpunctuated.  
Minutes spent,  
Hours worked,  
Days dreamed.  
  
As great as the lives that touched it,  
And as long as the lives it touched,  
Yours was a life.  
  
When a life has been truly lived,  
What is death?  
  
Nothing.
