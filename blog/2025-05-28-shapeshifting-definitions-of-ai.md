When I studied Computer Science at university, our introduction to AI began with a host of quotes:

- ‘We call programs intelligent if they exhibit behaviors that would be regarded intelligent if they were exhibited by human beings.’ Herbert Simon
- ‘AI is the study of techniques for solving exponentially hard problems in polynomial time by exploiting knowledge about the problem domain.’ Elaine Rich
- ‘AI is the study of how to make computers do things at which, at the moment, people are better.’ Elaine Rich and Kevin Knight
- ‘AI is the science of common sense.’ Claudson Bornstein
- ‘AI is the attempt to make computers do what people think computers cannot do.’ Douglas Baker
- ‘The study of methods by that a computer can simulate aspects of human intelligence.’ Computers and IT, 2003
- ‘Research scientists in AI try to get machines to exhibit behavior that we call intelligent behavior when we observe it in human beings.’ James Slagle
- ‘AI is a collective name for problems which we do not yet know how to solve properly by computer.’ Bertram Raphael
