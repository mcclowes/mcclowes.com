Design isn't a coat of paint you apply after the product requirements are done.

<!--truncate-->

I've worked with PMs who treat design as a hand-off. They write requirements, pass them to a designer, and expect something usable to come back. This fundamentally misunderstands what design is.

Design is ideation. It's problem-framing. It's understanding user mental models and building something that fits them. If you can't think like a designer as a PM, you won't be able to build truly usable experiences.

This doesn't mean PMs need to be pixel-pushers. It means they need to understand:

- **How constraints shape solutions** - design constraints aren't blockers, they're creative inputs
- **That the interface IS the product** - for most software, users don't interact with your architecture or your data model. They interact with buttons and flows
- **When "requirements" are actually design decisions in disguise** - "show all the data" vs "show relevant data" isn't a requirement, it's a design question

The best product work I've done has been when product thinking and design thinking were inseparable. The worst has been when I threw requirements over the wall and hoped design would "make it good."
