A poorly run experiment doesn't disprove a hypothesis. It proves nothing at all.

<!--truncate-->

I've seen teams run "experiments" that were doomed from the start:

- A/B tests where the variant was buggy
- Feature launches announced to 5% of users, creating confusion
- Prototypes so rough that users rejected the execution, not the concept
- Experiments with sample sizes too small to detect any effect

Then they'd conclude "users don't want this" or "the hypothesis was wrong."

No. The experiment was compromised. You can't draw any conclusions.

This is the unsexy truth about product experimentation: execution quality is a precondition for learning. If your implementation is sloppy, your test is meaningless.

This creates an uncomfortable trade-off. "Move fast and break things" doesn't pair well with "run rigorous experiments." You need enough craft to isolate what you're actually testing.

The best product teams I've worked with understood this. They didn't just ask "is this a good idea?" They asked "is this a good enough implementation to test the idea fairly?"

It's slower. It's less exciting than shipping and seeing what happens. But it's the only way to actually learn.
