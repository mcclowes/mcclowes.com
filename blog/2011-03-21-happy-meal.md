The sides of this set of Happy Meal boxes tell the story of three destructive behaviours of McDonalds and the resulting effects. Accompanying the boxes were a set of six toys based on the information on the boxes.

I recently found the first ever design document I created, from back in 2000.

Using both of these devices had become so painful simply because of poor battery life that it was worth the large price to buy new 
devices (with minimal trade-in values helping just a tiny bit). 

Obviously there are other benefits to these new devices. They are certainly faster and more responsive but ultimately the thing I 
just love is that when I turn the device on it works, it isn't out of battery. 
I can go and sit on the sofa and not be plugged in and my laptop isn't going to die on me. I could work there for an hour and then pop to the coffee shop for another few hours. 
I can watch YouTube on my phone on the bus, then take calls. None of my devices are running out of battery when I need them most.
