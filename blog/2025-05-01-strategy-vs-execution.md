When something isn't working, we rush to blame the strategy. But often the strategy was fine. We just didn't execute it well.

## The attribution problem

Strategy is abstract. Execution is messy. When results disappoint, it's easier to question the high-level direction than to examine the thousand small decisions that shaped the outcome.

"We need a new strategy" is cleaner than "we need to get better at dozens of things."

## Execution is invisible

Good execution looks obvious in retrospect. Bad execution is hard to see because it's distributed across many moments:
- The feature that shipped 80% complete
- The user research we skipped to hit a deadline
- The edge cases we decided not to handle
- The iteration we didn't do because we moved on

None of these feel strategic. All of them compound.

## How to tell the difference

Before abandoning a strategy, ask:
- Did we actually do what we said we'd do?
- Did we do it well, or just adequately?
- Did we give it enough time to work?
- What would excellent execution have looked like?

Sometimes the honest answer is: we never really tested the strategy because we never really executed it.

## The uncomfortable implication

If the problem is execution, the solution is harder. You can't just pivot to a new strategy. You have to get better at the unglamorous work of doing things well.

That's less exciting than a strategic pivot, but often more honest.
