Scepticism is not cynicism. This distinction matters.

<!--truncate-->

Cynicism assumes the worst. It's a pre-emptive defense mechanism - if you expect nothing good, you can't be disappointed. It's also corrosive. Cynics stop engaging, stop trying, stop caring.

Scepticism is different. It's active. It asks questions. It demands evidence. A sceptic doesn't assume something is false - they want to know why it's true.

In a world optimised for engagement over accuracy, scepticism is increasingly valuable. When every headline is designed to trigger a reaction, when algorithms surface content that confirms existing beliefs, the simple act of asking "is this actually true?" becomes almost radical.

Scepticism isn't about being difficult. It's about caring enough to interrogate claims before accepting them.

Cynics disengage. Sceptics engage more deeply.

The difference is crucial: a cynic says "this won't work because nothing works." A sceptic says "what evidence would convince me this works?"

One closes doors. The other keeps them open.
