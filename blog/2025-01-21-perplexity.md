A week ago I tried switching my web browser's default search engine from Google to [Perplexity](https://www.perplexity.ai/).

I've seen a lot of mention in the LinkedInfluencer discourse about people switching their default search engine over from Google to Perplexity and decided to try it out myself.

I quickly discovered something about the way I use search: 90% of the time 

To be fair to Perplexity, it consistently markets itself as a _research_ tool, rather than a search tool.
