Each of these Ps need to be in place, in order, or you're doomed.

## 1. Purpose

Purpose is the gravitational pull at the center of everything you do. It's not just your mission statement or vision deck; it's the quiet whisper guiding your hardest choices, shaping your culture, and drawing others to your cause. A business without true purpose drifts aimlessly, subject to whims and fashions. True purpose remains steady, shining brightest in times of uncertainty.

## 2. People

People aren't resourcesâ€”they are partners, collaborators, and co-creators of your vision. Good businesses cherish relationships, cultivating empathy, authenticity, and trust. Greatness emerges when people feel safe to explore, to fail, and ultimately, to flourish. Remember: businesses are made by and for humans, and humanity should always stay at the heart.

## 3. Process

Process is the invisible infrastructure that turns ideals into outcomes. It's neither bureaucracy nor a checklist; it's the quiet, relentless pursuit of doing things intentionally and sustainably. Effective processes should feel natural yet deliberate, offering clarity without stifling creativity. Well-designed processes set teams free to innovate rather than tethering them to routine.

## 4. Product

Your product is your promise made tangible. It's not just what you sell, but the expression of everything you believe in and represent. A meaningful product aligns seamlessly with your purpose, respects the people involved, and is delivered through thoughtful processes. At its best, your product leaves the world slightly better, easier, or more beautiful than you found it.
