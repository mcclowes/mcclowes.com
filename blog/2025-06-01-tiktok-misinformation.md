TikTok democratised high-quality video production. One consequence: misinformation now comes in professional packaging. People aren't calibrated for this.

## The old heuristics

We learned to assess credibility partly through production quality. Professional news looked professional. Amateur content looked amateur. You could use visual cues to gauge trustworthiness.

This was never perfect, but it was something.

## The new reality

Now anyone can produce slick, well-edited, visually compelling content. The tools are accessible. The techniques are learnable. Production value no longer signals institutional backing.

A random person with good lighting and editing skills can look as authoritative as a news organisation.

## The calibration problem

Our intuitions haven't caught up. High production value still triggers trust responses, even when the content is nonsense.

The medium is convincing, not the content.

## The dangerous combination

When you pair:
- Professional-looking presentation
- Confident delivery
- Algorithmic amplification
- Audience not calibrated for this

You get misinformation that spreads faster and convinces more effectively than ever.

## What's the answer?

Media literacy needs updating. We need to teach that production quality means nothing about truthfulness. Anyone can make convincing-looking content.

But updating collective intuitions is slow. The tools moved faster than our defences.
