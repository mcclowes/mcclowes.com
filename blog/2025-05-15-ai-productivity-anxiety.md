AI tools have made me so productive that disconnecting now feels like a liability. This is a new kind of anxiety.

## The productivity delta

When I'm connected with AI assistance, I can move faster than ever. Research, writing, coding, problem-solving. The tools amplify everything.

When I disconnect, I'm back to baseline human speed. The contrast is stark.

## The new FOMO

It's not fear of missing social updates. It's fear of being inefficient. Every hour offline is an hour at reduced capacity.

This is different from pre-AI productivity anxiety. It's not "I should be working." It's "I should be working at my augmented capacity."

## The trap

Of course, this is partly irrational. Focused offline time has its own value. Deep thinking, genuine rest, perspective that comes from stepping back.

But the feeling persists. The tools are there, waiting. Every moment I'm not using them feels like waste.

## Is this sustainable?

Probably not. The always-on, always-augmented mindset leads to burnout just like any other form of overwork.

But recognising that doesn't make the feeling go away. When you've experienced accelerated productivity, normal speed feels like moving through treacle.

We'll need to develop new norms around when and how to disconnect. The old advice about unplugging doesn't account for the cost of leaving your best tools behind.
