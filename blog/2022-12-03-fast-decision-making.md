As a product manager, making decisions is a big part of the job. While we all want to make the right decision every time, sometimes things don't go as planned. It can be tempting to try to stick with a decision, even when it's not working, but I've learned that it's better to be able to reverse course and make a new decision.

That's why I believe that being able to make quick decisions is an important skill for product managers to develop. Of course, I'm not saying that you should make hasty decisions without considering all the relevant factors. Rather, I'm advocating for a mindset of agility and adaptability. Sometimes, taking too long to make a decision can lead to missed opportunities or wasted resources.

One approach to reversing a decision is to focus on delivering incremental value and measuring success. By breaking down the product roadmap into smaller, manageable pieces, you can test assumptions in real-time and make adjustments as needed. Additionally, defining clear metrics and goals for the product allows you to measure success and determine if the decision is delivering the intended results.

If you find that a decision needs to be reversed, don't panic. It's not the end of the world! Acting quickly and transparently is key. Involve your team and stakeholders in the decision-making process, analyze the impact of the decision, and make necessary adjustments to the product strategy.

Now, let's talk about the importance of making quick decisions in more detail. When you're a product manager, there's often a lot riding on the decisions you make. Whether it's a new feature, a change to the pricing strategy, or a major pivot, the success of the product can be affected by your decisions.

Of course, you don't want to make decisions recklessly or without considering all the relevant factors. But sometimes, taking too long to make a decision can be just as harmful as making a bad decision. That's why I believe in the value of agility and adaptability.

By being willing to make quick decisions and iterate on them as necessary, you can move faster and more effectively. It's important to be open to feedback and to continually test and refine your assumptions. This can help you avoid getting stuck in a decision that isn't working out.

When you're able to make quick decisions, you can also better respond to changing market conditions or customer needs. In a fast-paced industry, being able to pivot quickly can make all the difference.

Ultimately, the ability to reverse a decision is a valuable skill for product managers. By focusing on delivering incremental value and measuring success, we can make informed decisions and quickly reverse course if necessary. Don't be afraid to admit when a decision isn't working out, and don't let fear of failure prevent you from taking action. By embracing a mindset of agility and adaptability, we can be better product managers and drive more successful and effective product strategies.
