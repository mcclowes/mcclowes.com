title: "Your PMs don't need more time writing PRDs"

I've seen teams obsess over PRD templates, documentation standards, and specification formats. Meanwhile, their PMs barely use the product they're building.

## The documentation trap

PRDs have their place. Alignment matters. But I've watched teams spend more time perfecting documents than understanding their product.

The PRD becomes a proxy for actual knowledge. "It's in the spec" replaces "I've experienced this myself."

## Use the product

The best product insights come from using what you build. Not occasionally. Constantly.

- Feel the friction users feel
- Notice what's clunky before users report it
- Develop intuition for what's right and wrong
- Understand the product deeply enough to make fast decisions

No amount of user research replaces firsthand experience.

## Dogfooding isn't optional

If your PMs aren't regular users of your product, they're working from abstractions. They're making decisions based on secondhand reports rather than lived experience.

This doesn't mean ignoring user research. It means supplementing it with genuine understanding.

## The time trade-off

Every hour spent polishing a PRD is an hour not spent using the product, talking to users, or thinking deeply about problems.

I'd rather have a PM with a rough spec and deep product knowledge than one with a beautiful document and shallow understanding.
