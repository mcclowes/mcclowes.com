The QOL of this...

:::tip Libre Link

Libre Link recently released an update 
:::

## How it works

Shuggah uses the Libre FreeStyle 2's Bluetooth connectivity to record sugar levels

Shuggah will then create calendar events in the calendar of your choosing. These events are named e.g. `3.7 -> 0.1`, showing your last reading level, the direction of travel, and how big the reading has changed.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Download [Shuggah](https://apps.apple.com/sa/app/shuggah/id1586789452) (or find a similar [xdrip4ios](https://xdrip4ios.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) app)
- Disable Bluetooth for Libre Link (withing the iOS Settings app)
- Create an Calendar

### Settings

#### General

- Blood Glucose Units - mmol/L
- Master or Follower? - Master
- Show BG in Notifications? Disabled
- Show BG in the APp Badge? Enabled
- Multiply App Badge Reading by 10? Enabled

#### Calendar Events

- Create Calendar Events? Enabled
- Calendar to use?

- **Phone battery** - Your phone battery will drain signficantly faster. The calendar app's syncing of calendars consistently uses 30% of my battery, which has meant my phone dies and I can't get a reading.
