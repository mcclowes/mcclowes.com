A solitary gull  
arced over stone,  
mimicked  
by a white vessel  
far above and away  
which could not flap its wings.  
  
<!--truncate-->  
  
Fragments of light,  
shattered by concrete structures  
(poor emulations of mountains),  
warmed its body  
against the cool air.  
  
It dreamed of azure  
and the monotony  
of crashing waves,  
endlessly complex and unknowable,  
a sea it has never known.
