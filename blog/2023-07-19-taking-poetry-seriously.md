Engaging in poetry requires putting your mind in a certain mode. You can't just fit poetry into the mundanity of everyday life, unless we're talking about limericks in the vein of Edward Lear. This is because poetry carries a sort of inherent mythology, a seriousness, a fantastical element.

To read poetry written by a friend, it has to represent their personal truth—a truth that you can empathize with, relate to, and understand. If the reading of the poetry is insincere, and if the poetry is presented without its surrounding mythology, it tends to deconstruct itself, appearing fascinal.

It's challenging to engage with poetry on a regular basis, and even more so to do it successfully. I find that music can aid this process significantly. Writing in the style of someone else can have a similar deconstructing effect as listening to someone read poetry.

To adopt the voice of another writer and to emulate their style removes all the truth, sincerity, and magic of it. Perhaps this gets to the heart of what it is to read someone else's poetry—if it's not your truth, it becomes very difficult not to undermine that same truth.
