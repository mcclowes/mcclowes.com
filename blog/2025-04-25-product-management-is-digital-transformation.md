Digital transformation has become a buzzword that means everything and nothing. But strip away the consultant-speak, and what you're left with is product management.

## What transformation actually means

When organisations talk about digital transformation, they usually mean:
- Building software that changes how they operate
- Shifting from projects to products
- Becoming more responsive to users
- Making decisions based on data

This is just... product management.

## The rebrand

"Digital transformation" emerged partly because traditional businesses needed language that felt strategic and executive-level. "We're hiring product managers" doesn't get board approval. "We're undergoing digital transformation" does.

Same work, different framing.

## Why this matters

If your organisation is "transforming digitally," it needs product people. Not project managers with new titles. Not consultants running workshops. People who understand how to discover, build, and iterate on software products.

The transformation isn't the technology. It's developing the capability to continuously improve digital products based on user needs and business goals.

## The uncomfortable truth

Many transformation initiatives fail because they treat it as a one-time project rather than an ongoing capability. You don't transform and then stop. You build the muscle to keep adapting.

That's what good product organisations do. They've just been doing it without the fancy name.
