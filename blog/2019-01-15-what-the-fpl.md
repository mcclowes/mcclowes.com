I built my first version of **What the FPL!?** in 2019 as a simple tool to help me make better decisions in Fantasy Premier League. It was a basic web app that collected player data and predicted points using a straightforward algorithm.

The original version was much simpler than the current rebuild. It used a basic predicted points algorithm that calculated potential scores based on player form, fixture difficulty, and recent performance. While it wasn't as sophisticated as the expectation-weighted fitness metrics I use now, it still gave me a useful edge in making transfer decisions.

The tool was built with a simple tech stack and focused on the core functionality: fetching player data, calculating predicted points, and displaying them in an easy-to-use interface. It helped me understand which players were likely to perform well in upcoming gameweeks.

The mobile view made it easy to check predictions on the go, especially when I needed to make quick transfer decisions before the weekly deadline. While the predicted points algorithm was simpler, it still incorporated the key factors that mattered: form, fixtures, and player value.

This original version taught me a lot about what works and what doesn't when building fantasy football tools. Those lessons directly informed the more sophisticated approach I'd take in the 2024 rebuild.
