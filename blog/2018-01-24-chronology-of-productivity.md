To-do lists are arguably the simplest tools. Write down a task, then tick it off when it's complete. However, how I use to-do lists, where they fit into my life, and their manifestations have been ever-changing for the past nine years. 

Some thoughts on poetry...

Currently, I use the tool Things 3, but my choice to use this tool was influenced by my previous choice to use Wunderlist. Prior to that, I explored various versions of paper-based to-do lists.

Even now, I'm still drawn to a paper-based to-do list, something aesthetically appealing about it. But ultimately, digital to-do lists offer significant advantages that I can't ignore. When I say this, I recall my first to-do list, which was a school homework diary we were required to use. My organization was so poor that I often left them at home. When it's not there for you, it's no longer a reliable source of truth and thus becomes useless.

The failures of these initial planners stemmed from their lack of flexibility. They were pre-planned, generic planners with predetermined note-taking structures. Half of the pages were school rules or content that you needed to share, limiting privacy. These were big, inconvenient items, which likely contributed to me forgetting them or not having them to hand when needed.

Things changed significantly when I began an Art Foundation course post-A Levels. Two critical changes occur when undertaking an arts degree. First, observation becomes important. Your time outside of the classroom becomes your study time, forcing you to carry something to document your observations. Consequently, I started using a notebook, marking the first time introspection began feeding into my daily activities.

I started using a notebook from Muji, which later transitioned to Moleskine notebooks. I began thinking about game design and development, jotting down my ideas. However, the convenience of a smaller notebook, an A6 from Muji, soon became a priority. That switch might have been a mistake, as the larger A5 format was better suited to the work I was doing.

Around this time, I started using digital calendars on my first smartphone. The more I used a digital calendar, the more a digital to-do list made sense. As I transitioned to Durham University, I adopted a digital to-do list and calendar. Unfortunately, I tried to switch to Evernote for my organization and to-do lists, which didn't work well for me. My organization faltered, and without features like reminders and the tactility of a physical notebook, my productivity suffered.

Post-university, when starting my own business, I rediscovered the absolute necessity of to-do lists. At this time, I discovered the Bullet Journal, a simple paper-based system. I started using a hybrid version that worked well for me, primarily for work-related tasks, while using Wunderlist for personal tasks.

In my tech-based work, I came across a tool called 'Things,' and I switched from Wunderlist to this new tool. Wunderlist was being phased out by Microsoft, so I looked for an alternative. Initially, 'Things' didn't work for me either. I was still mostly working on paper, but the advantage of a digital to-do list is that when you return to it, none of the information is lost.

Reflecting on this issue led me to separate my habit tracking from my to-do list, changing the way I used 'Things.' I use a habit tracker called 'Habitify' along with 'Things.' The latter is used for key tasks and long-term reminders. These tasks are written down at the beginning of the day, and what I don't complete is either moved to the next day or put back on the digital to-do list for later. For the habit tracker, if you fail, be truthful and mark it as failed. This approach separates to-do lists from habit trackers and makes these tools more effective in my life.

This is a critical distinction from a task that simply needs to be done at some point versus a habit that needs to be done today and will need to be done again tomorrow. If you miss today, you either need to do it twice tomorrow or admit that you failed to do it today.

Understanding that you can let habits go and admit failure, without having to make up for them another day, invalidates the use of a normal to-do list. That's probably why I used to end up with twice as many to-do lists than I could handle, which I believe is symptomatic of a greater fear of failure, something I need to work on.

Switching to a tool that does the job, and not trying to force habits into my to-do list application, helps mitigate this fear of failure. It eases the fear of feeling that I am currently failing because I forgot to do push-ups yesterday, for example.

This brings me to the final issue with to-do lists: taking on more than you can reasonably accomplish in a day. The final addition to the way I use 'Things' has been to use tags, because it has a tagging system, to predict how long it will take me to do each task, and to only allot myself tasks that I can reasonably handle.
