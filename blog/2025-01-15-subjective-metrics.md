Sometimes the most useful metrics are subjective.

<!--truncate-->

Product teams obsess over quantitative metrics. DAU. Conversion rate. Time to value. These are important.

But I've found that some of the most valuable signals come from subjective assessments: red/amber/green status, confidence scores, qualitative ratings.

Here's why: when your product is immature or broken in fundamental ways, quantitative metrics often don't help. A feature with 2% adoption might have 2% adoption because:

- Users don't know it exists
- The UI is confusing
- It's buggy
- It solves a problem users don't have
- It solves the wrong problem

One number can't distinguish between these. But a PM or designer can look at the feature and say "this is red - the core interaction doesn't make sense" or "this is amber - the concept is sound but the discoverability is poor."

Traffic light assessments force you to synthesise multiple inputs into a judgement. They require you to think, not just measure.

The danger is that they're subjective - they can be gamed, biased, or self-serving. But so can quantitative metrics. At least subjective assessments are honest about what they are.

For early-stage product work, I'd often rather have a thoughtful red/amber/green assessment than a dashboard of noisy numbers.
