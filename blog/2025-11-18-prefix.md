I've been working on a new game called Prefix.

You have to guess the word of the day (usually a 5-12 letter word). You start with the first letter revealed. By guessing words that fit given the letters revealed so far, you gradually arrive at the right answer.

You can play it [here](https://prefix.mcclowes.com/).

  ]}
/>

It looks a bit like Wordle, but it's actually an attempt to make a 1-player version of the fantastic word game [Contact](https://www.ludozofi.com/home/games/contact/).
