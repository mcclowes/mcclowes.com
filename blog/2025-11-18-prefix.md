I've been working on a new game called Prefix.

You can play it [here](https://prefix.mcclowes.com/).

<Carousel 
  images={[
    "/img/posts/puzzles/prefix-o-1.PNG",
    "/img/posts/puzzles/prefix-o-2.PNG",
    "/img/posts/puzzles/prefix-o-3.PNG",
  ]}
/>

It looks a bit like Wordle, but it's actually based on the fantastic word game [contact](https://www.ludozofi.com/home/games/contact/).

### How to play
