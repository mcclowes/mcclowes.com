I've finally organized my development environment setup into a proper dotfiles repository. After years of manually configuring each new machine, I decided to automate the whole process.

<!--truncate-->

The repository includes everything I need to get a new macOS machine up and running: Homebrew packages, git configuration, zsh setup with oh-my-zsh, and global npm packages. It's all managed through bootstrap scripts that handle the installation and configuration.

### What's included

The setup covers the main areas of my development environment:

**Homebrew** - All my essential packages and applications. Development tools like git, node, and python, plus applications via Cask like VS Code, Chrome, and Slack. Even fonts get installed automatically.

**Git** - Global configuration with my preferred settings, delta diff viewer setup, and Git LFS support. I can customize the user settings before running the bootstrap.

**Zsh** - Oh-my-zsh framework with my custom plugins and theme. Helpful functions and aliases that I've accumulated over the years, plus PATH configuration for common tools.

**npm** - Global npm packages that I use across projects.

### The bootstrap process

The main `bootstrap.sh` script walks through the setup process step by step. Each component has its own bootstrap script, so I can run individual parts if I only need to update something specific. It's made setting up new machines so much faster—what used to take hours of manual configuration now takes minutes.

The repository is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/mcclowes/dotfiles) if you want to see how it's structured or use it as a starting point for your own setup. It's a work in progress, but having everything in one place and automated has been a game changer for me.
