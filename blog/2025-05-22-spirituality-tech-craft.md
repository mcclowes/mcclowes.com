There's a spiritual dimension to making things well that we've largely stripped out of tech work. I think we lost something important.

## The Japanese model

Japanese craft traditions embed spiritual practice in making. The tea ceremony, calligraphy, sword-making. The act of creation is also an act of presence, discipline, and meaning-making.

The craftsperson isn't just producing an object. They're engaged in something that transcends the output.

## What we've lost

Modern tech work is largely instrumental. We build things to achieve outcomes: growth, revenue, efficiency. The work is a means to an end.

This isn't wrong, but it's incomplete. It misses the dimension of work as practice, as something that can be meaningful in itself.

## Why it matters

When work is purely instrumental:
- Burnout comes faster
- Quality suffers (good enough replaces good)
- We lose the motivation that comes from caring about craft
- Work feels hollow even when successful

The spiritual dimension isn't about religion. It's about meaning, presence, and the intrinsic value of doing things well.

## Recovering craft

Some tech cultures preserve this. Teams that care about code quality beyond what's strictly necessary. Designers who obsess over details users might not notice. Engineers who find joy in elegant solutions.

This is the craft tradition, even if we don't call it that. It's worth protecting.
