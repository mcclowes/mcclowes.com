We pay lip service to creativity while systematically undervaluing it. The gap between what we say and what we reward is vast.

<!--truncate-->

## The rhetoric

Everyone claims to value creativity. Job descriptions want "creative thinkers." Companies talk about innovation. We celebrate creative individuals.

## The reality

Actually creative work is:
- Underpaid relative to optimisation work
- Harder to get approved
- Riskier for career advancement
- Less legible to management

The structures we build reward efficiency, predictability, and incremental improvement. Genuine creativity is disruptive and uncomfortable.

## Why the gap exists

Creative work is uncertain. You can't predict outcomes reliably. ROI calculations don't work well.

Organisations are risk-averse. They optimise for predictability. Creative work is by definition unpredictable.

So we end up valuing creativity in theory while punishing it in practice.

## The cost

When creativity is undervalued:
- Products become samey
- Problems that need new thinking don't get solved
- Creative people leave or stop trying
- Organisations become brittle

You can optimise your way to local maxima. You need creativity to find new peaks entirely.

## What would change

If we actually valued creativity, we'd:
- Pay for it explicitly
- Create protected space for uncertain work
- Promote creative people even when projects fail
- Measure differently

Until the incentives change, the undervaluation continues.
