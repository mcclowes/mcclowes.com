Digital technology was supposed to make life easier. Instead, it absorbs attention and resources that used to go to the physical world. No wonder things feel like they're falling apart.

## The attention shift

Time and attention are finite. Every hour spent on screens is an hour not spent elsewhere. We've shifted enormous amounts of collective attention from physical reality to digital spaces.

This isn't neutral. Physical infrastructure, communities, and systems need attention to function.

## The maintenance deficit

Digital products demand constant engagement. Updates, notifications, new platforms, new content. The attention cost keeps rising.

Meanwhile, the physical world is in maintenance deficit. Public spaces, relationships, local institutions. The things that require presence and attention to sustain.

## The second-order problems

Once you're deep in digital, you spend time solving digital problems:
- Managing information overload
- Fixing tech issues
- Learning new tools
- Dealing with online conflict

These problems didn't exist before. They're created by the shift itself. And solving them consumes more attention.

## The uncomfortable question

What would happen if we redirected even a fraction of the attention currently absorbed by digital back to physical reality?

Better maintained public spaces. Stronger local communities. More present relationships. Less decay.

I don't know how to make this happen at scale. But it's worth naming: digital doesn't just add. It also subtracts from what was there before.
