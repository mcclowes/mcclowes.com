Here's another cryptic crossword puzzle to challenge your mind. Cryptic crosswords are a wonderful way to exercise your brain - they require wordplay, lateral thinking, and pattern recognition all at once.

The beauty of cryptic clues is that they often have multiple layers of meaning. Each clue typically contains both a definition and a wordplay element, and part of the fun is figuring out which is which.

If you're new to cryptic crosswords, don't worry - they get easier with practice. Start by looking for the definition (usually at the beginning or end of the clue) and then work on the wordplay.
