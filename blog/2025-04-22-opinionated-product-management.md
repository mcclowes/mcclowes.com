The best PMs I've worked with have opinions. Strong ones. They don't hide behind data or defer every decision to stakeholders.

## The myth of the neutral PM

There's a version of product management that positions the PM as a neutral facilitator. Gather requirements, prioritise objectively, let the data decide.

This is a fantasy. Every decision involves judgment. Pretending otherwise just obscures who's actually making the calls.

## Why opinions matter

When you have a clear point of view:
- Decisions happen faster
- The product has coherence
- Teams know what you stand for
- Debates become productive rather than circular

An opinion isn't a closed mind. It's a starting position that can be updated with evidence.

## Holding opinions loosely

The trick is combining conviction with openness. Have a view, but be genuinely willing to change it when presented with compelling evidence.

"Strong opinions, weakly held" gets overused, but the core insight is right. Certainty and flexibility aren't opposites.

## The cost of neutrality

PMs who won't commit to a position create vacuums. Someone else fills them, often the loudest voice or the highest-paid person's opinion.

If you're not bringing judgment to the table, what are you bringing?
