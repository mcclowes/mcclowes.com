I made you in my image  
So you could have everything I’m proud of.  
  
<!--truncate-->    
  
I asked you to be observant so you could see  
Everything I’m too oblivious to hate about myself  
(And all I’m painfully aware of).  
  
I hoped you’d have her fire so you could  
Warm the world around you  
While I have waned.  
  
She said you look like me  
And I say you look like her  
From the nose down.  
And I guess that’s the point.
