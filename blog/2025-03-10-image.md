I made you in my image  
so you could have everything I’m proud of.  
  
<!--truncate-->    
  
I asked you to be observant so you could see  
everything I’m too oblivious to hate about myself  
(and all I’m painfully aware of).  
  
I hoped you’d have her fire so you could  
warm the world around you  
while I have waned.  
  
She said you look like me  
and I say you look like her  
from the nose down.  
And I guess that’s the point.
