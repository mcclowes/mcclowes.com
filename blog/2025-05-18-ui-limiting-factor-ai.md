AI capabilities are racing ahead. The interfaces for using them aren't keeping up. UI is becoming the bottleneck.

<!--truncate-->

## The capability gap

Models can do more than we know how to ask them. More than we can easily access. The raw capability is there, but it's locked behind interfaces that don't expose it well.

Chat is the dominant paradigm, but it's a narrow channel for rich capabilities.

## What chat gets wrong

Chat is great for some things. Terrible for others:
- Hard to specify complex constraints
- Linear conversation doesn't match branching exploration
- No good way to manipulate structured outputs
- Context management is opaque
- Iteration is clunky

We're typing paragraphs to do things that could be a few clicks.

## What better UI looks like

We're starting to see hints:
- Canvas/artifact interfaces for working with outputs
- Structured inputs for common tasks
- Visual representations of context and memory
- Integration into existing workflows rather than separate chat windows

The next wave of AI products will be defined more by UI innovation than model improvements.

## The opportunity

If you're building AI products, the differentiator increasingly isn't the model. It's how you expose its capabilities. The teams that crack AI UX will capture enormous value.

The models are becoming commodities. The interfaces aren't.
