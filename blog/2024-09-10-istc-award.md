Super excited to have our Codat documentation recognised by the [Institue of Scientific Technical Communicators](https://istc.org.uk/).

> Codat Docs is a documentation portal that is complementary to Codatâ€™s product suite. These products allow companies such as banks, payment providers, fintechs, and more, to connect to the software their small business clients use, access their business data, get insights from that data, and automate their accounting processes.

> Codat Docs contains guides for beginners, product- and use case-specific tutorials and guides, API references and technical implementation details for the full suite of products, and general usage details for our APIs and integrations.

> It is a challenging task to write documentation that needs to cater for users with varying degrees of knowledge, but this guide has achieved this task very well. There are various places where there is a table at the top specifying the audience and the knowledge needed. It is good to see this information up front.

> This is a particularly good example of great documentation. The entry said there are two people in the Experience team who brought the entry to this level. It is a credit to both members as you can see the hard work that has gone into creating this portal.

> Having embedded code snippets of the various coding languages was a nice touch as qas the ability to toggle back and forth. It was very easy to navigate through and it was a natural flow. The landing page is clear on where you can find everything you could need. The stated objective has been met very well with care taken on presentation to convey information to best effect.
