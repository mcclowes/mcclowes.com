Product management isn't purely top-down strategy or bottom-up discovery. The best product work moves in both directions simultaneously.

<!--truncate-->

## Top-down: vision and constraints

Leadership sets direction. Business goals, market positioning, resource constraints. This isn't optional context, it's the frame within which product decisions make sense.

PMs who ignore top-down input end up building features that don't serve the business, no matter how well-researched.

## Bottom-up: reality and opportunity

Users, engineers, support teams, and data all surface what's actually happening. Patterns emerge. Opportunities appear that no strategy document predicted.

PMs who ignore bottom-up signals end up executing a strategy that's disconnected from reality.

## The bidirectional flow

Good product management synthesises both. You're constantly:
- Translating strategy into actionable problems
- Translating ground-level insights into strategic opportunities
- Challenging assumptions in both directions

The PM sits at the intersection, not as a messenger, but as a translator and synthesiser.

## Where it goes wrong

When organisations treat product as purely execution (top-down only), they miss opportunities and build the wrong things confidently.

When they treat product as purely discovery (bottom-up only), they lack coherence and drift without purpose.

The tension between these forces is the job. Embrace it.
