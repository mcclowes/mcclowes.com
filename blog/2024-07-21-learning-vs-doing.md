I've been thinking lately that I should spend 10% less time doing, and 10% more time learning.

The logic is straightforward: investing more in learning helps ensure that I'm focused on doing the right things. It's about building with velocity rather than merely speed—because speed alone can lead directly into the "build trap," busy but ineffective.

But this isn't just a personal reflection—it's essential for teams too. Ensuring your team has dedicated space for learning isn't optional; it's a fundamental part of your role. If learning and development aren't mandated and protected, they simply won't happen.

'10% time' is your job, not a nice-to-have. When we slow down just enough to reflect and learn, we calibrate our compass. We clarify direction and purpose. Then, when we move forward, we do so with intention and impact.

Less frantic action, more deliberate growth.
