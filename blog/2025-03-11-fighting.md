To hold hands  
Is to be in chains.  
  
<!--truncate-->    
  
Yours is a limitless force  
That needs unboundedness  
And to test the limits of reality.  
  
Moments of peace,  
Fleeting,  
When I can hold you  
Are but a conspiracy of entropy.  
Then you spin and twist and thrash  
And are scattered.  
  
As you charge off into  
Nowhere,  
You turn back  
And I know that, whilst I canâ€™t hold you,  
You need me nearby.  
  
I follow.
