To hold hands  
is to be in chains.  
  
<!--truncate-->    
  
Yours is a limitless force  
that needs unboundedness  
and to test the limits of reality.  
  
Moments of peace,  
fleeting,  
when I can hold you  
are but a conspiracy of entropy.  
Then you spin and twist and thrash  
and are scattered.  
  
As you charge off into  
nowhere,  
you turn back  
and I know that, whilst I canâ€™t hold you,  
you need me nearby.  
  
I follow.
