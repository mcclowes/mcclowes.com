Here's a theory: the cost of car ownership is a massive drag on productivity that we don't account for properly.

## The obvious costs

Cars are expensive:
- Purchase or lease payments
- Insurance
- Fuel
- Parking
- Taxes

People know this. It's priced into decisions, sort of.

## The hidden costs

What's less visible:
- Mental load of maintenance schedules
- Time lost to repairs and servicing
- Stress of unexpected breakdowns
- Cognitive burden of traffic and navigation
- Health costs of sedentary commuting

These don't show up in accounting, but they're real.

## The productivity drain

Every hour spent dealing with car stuff is an hour not spent on something else. Every bit of mental energy on parking and traffic is energy not available for other problems.

At population scale, this adds up to enormous amounts of lost capacity.

## The infrastructure lock-in

The problem is systemic. Most places are designed around cars. Not owning one means major life constraints. So even if you'd prefer alternatives, you're often locked in.

We've built a world where the productivity drain of cars is mandatory for most people.

## What would change

If we redesigned around people instead of cars:
- More time available for productive work
- Less cognitive load
- Better health outcomes
- More money in household budgets

The car isn't just an expense. It's a tax on attention and energy that we've normalised.
