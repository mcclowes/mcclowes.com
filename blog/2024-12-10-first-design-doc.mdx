I recently found the first ever design document I created, from back in 2000.

<!--truncate-->

Aged 10, I designed two ambitious open-world games that I documented in these design documents.

The first was **The Tombs** - an open-world game set in ancient Egypt where you fought the undead. I can see from the document that I was thinking about exploration mechanics, combat systems, and the atmospheric setting of Egyptian tombs.

/>

The second was **WWII: Dropzone** - an open-world game where you played as a paratrooper behind enemy lines during World War II. This one seems to have focused on stealth mechanics, survival elements, and the tension of operating alone in hostile territory.

It's fascinating looking back at these now, decades later. Even at 10 years old, I was drawn to open-world design and complex game mechanics. The themes I chose - ancient Egypt with undead, and WWII paratrooper survival - show an early interest in atmospheric, immersive experiences.

These documents capture a moment in time when I was just beginning to understand what games could be, and how to think about designing them. It's weird reflecting on these childhood creations now, seeing the seeds of what would become a lifelong interest in game design and interactive experiences.
