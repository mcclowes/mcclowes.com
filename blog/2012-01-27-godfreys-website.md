In 2012, I created a website for Godfreys, a London-based butcher, where I also worked as an assistant butcher for 4 years. Twelve years later, I still see the branding I created driving around London weekly.

## The Project

Godfreys is a family-run butcher in London. They needed a website that would reflect their traditional values while being modern and user-friendly. The brief was simple: showcase their quality products, make it easy for customers to find locations and contact information, and maintain the warm, personal feel of a family business.

## The Design

The website featured a clean, professional design that emphasized quality and tradition. I used warm colors and high-quality food photography to create an inviting atmosphere. The layout was straightforward and mobile-friendly (which was still relatively new in 2012).

## The Award

The Meat Industry best website award was a nice recognition, but the real success has been the longevity of the branding. The logo and visual identity I created are still in use today, appearing on delivery vans, shop fronts, and marketing materials across London.

## The Legacy

What's most satisfying about this project isn't the award itself, but seeing the branding still in use over a decade later. It's a reminder that good design can have real staying power. When I see a Godfreys van driving past, I know that the visual identity I helped create is still serving the business well.

## Lessons Learned

This project taught me that the best design work isn't just about winning awards or creating something that looks good in a portfolio. It's about creating something that serves the business and its customers for years to come. The fact that Godfreys is still using the branding I created in 2012 speaks to the value of thoughtful, strategic design.

Sometimes the most rewarding projects aren't the flashiest or most technically complex. They're the ones that quietly serve their purpose year after year, becoming part of the fabric of a business and its community.
