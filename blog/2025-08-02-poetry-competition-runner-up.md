The [Laughter Lines poetry competition](https://penstricken.com/2025/08/02/winner-of-laughter-lines-poetry-competition-announced/) was run by [Penstricken](https://penstricken.com/), a literary magazine. My poem "Sunset" was one of the top three runners up.

The winner was Ana Reisens with her poem "The Translated Instruction Manual for Loving", which used funny excerpts from badly translated instruction manuals to create a poetic guide for love. The other runners up were Larry Needham with "Marriage Bed of the Roses" and Jim Burns with "Tourist Trap".

All four poems will appear in their upcoming Autumn issue, *Machinery.*
