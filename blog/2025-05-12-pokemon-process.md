I've been making Fakemon (fake pokemon) using a combination of traditional sketching and modern AI tools. The journey takes us from initial concept sketches through ChatGPT refinement, and finally to Sora for animation.

In this post, I'll walk you through my process of creating Fakemon (fan-made Pokémon) using a combination of traditional sketching and modern AI tools. The journey takes us from initial concept sketches through ChatGPT refinement, and finally to Sora for animation.

## Initial Sketching Phase

The process began with traditional pencil and paper sketches. This phase is crucial for getting the basic concept down and exploring different design possibilities. I usually start with a type combo, and try and come up with I focused on creating unique and interesting silhouettes while maintaining the distinctive Pokémon style. After the initial rough sketch, I refined the design with more detailed linework.

## Bringing it to Life

With ChatGPT's new o3 model & image generation, and some specific prompts I've crafted, I've found I can get pretty great fake Pokemon designs. I just upload a photograph of the above in the prompt, and ask for a more refined version of the design, with specific reference to the creatures type, colours, etc.

Then I creatged an image for card art, in this case a holographic design variant:

## Animation with Sora

The final step was using Sora to generate an animated version of Ghowlish. This brought the creature to life, allowing us to see its movements and expressions in action:

I find this incredibly hit and miss, and it's still absolutely awful most of the time, but in this case I actually got a good result.

## Fleshing out the character

You can also turn to ChatGPT to help refine the design and develop the Pokémon's characteristics. I've used prompts to design its abilities and moves, and more.
