As I recently posted, I bought the AirPods Max and one of the nice features there was its massive 20-hour battery life.
This is actually the third device I bought in six months where battery life has been a massive part of loving it.

I purposely bought the previous two devices just for the battery life. I had an iPhone 12 and whether it would make it through the day was unpredictable.

I also had a MacBook Pro from 2017 which really struggled to make it through one hour on the go. Its battery had degraded that much and of course within 20 minutes it was on energy saving mode and it had to slow down.

Using both of these devices had become so painful simply because of poor battery life that it was worth the large price to buy new

The true balancing of these concerns is where the product led organization lies.
