I've always found maintaining a CV to be a pain. Word documents are awkward to version control, LaTeX is overkill for most people, and PDFs are hard to edit. I wanted something that was simple to maintain, looked professional, and could be easily shared.

That's why I built [cv-maker](https://github.com/mcclowes/cv-maker) - a tool that generates beautiful CVs from Markdown files and outputs them in both HTML and PDF formats.

## The problem

Traditional CV formats have their issues:

- **Word documents** are hard to version control and track changes
- **PDFs** are difficult to edit and maintain
- **LaTeX** is powerful but has a steep learning curve
- **Online CV builders** lock you into their platform and make it hard to export

I wanted something that was:
- Simple to write and maintain
- Easy to version control
- Shareable in multiple formats
- Professional looking out of the box

## The solution

cv-maker lets you write your CV in Markdown, which is easy to read, write, and maintain. You can version control it with git, track changes, and collaborate easily. The tool then generates both HTML and PDF versions automatically.

### What it does

**Markdown-based**: Write your CV in plain Markdown, which is simple, readable, and easy to edit.

**Multiple outputs**: Generate both HTML and PDF versions from the same source file.

**Professional styling**: Clean, professional design that works well in both formats.

**Easy to share**: HTML can be hosted anywhere, and PDFs can be downloaded or printed.

**Version control friendly**: Markdown files are plain text, making them perfect for git and collaborative editing.

## How it works

You write your CV in a `cv.md` file, then run the build process to generate both HTML and PDF versions. The HTML version is clean and shareable, and the PDF version is print-ready.

The tool uses a simple build process that converts Markdown to HTML, applies styling, and then generates PDFs using headless browser rendering.

## Try it out

You can check out the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/mcclowes/cv-maker) to see the source code, examples, and instructions for getting started.

The project is open source and available as a template, so you can fork it and customize it to your needs.
