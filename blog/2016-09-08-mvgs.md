It is important to consider the role of government in providing minimal viable goods and services (MVGS) to its citizens. These services include essential needs such as water, food, and infrastructure that ensure an acceptable standard of health, mobility, education, communication, behavior, and morality for all members of society. The government's responsibility is to guarantee these services are consistently available and of necessary quality.

While the private sector may bring efficiency, it cannot guarantee consistency and quality. Therefore, the government must be the supplier of MVGS to ensure that its citizens are not subjected to substandard living conditions or compromised safety due to the failures of the private sector. The government serves as a guarantor of the standards by which we live our lives and conduct our business. Through legislation and judicial processes, it enshrines codes of conduct, morality, and living standards. By doing so, the government plays an essential role in upholding social welfare and ensuring a just and fair society for all. The privatization of public services is not an option if we are to maintain a fair and just society.

Health, mobility, education, communication, behavior, and morality are essential components of a functional and just society. Health enables individuals to lead productive lives, mobility allows for access to employment and resources, education promotes personal growth and societal progress, communication fosters understanding and cooperation, behavior ensures social order and safety, and morality shapes our values and ethical standards.

Given the importance of these minimum viable goods and services (MVGS), it is crucial that they are provided consistently and to the necessary quality. While the private sector may offer efficiencies, it cannot guarantee the level of consistency and quality necessary to ensure that these MVGS are available to all members of society.

Therefore, it follows that the government should take ultimate responsibility for ensuring standards and delivering services. As the guarantor of the standard by which we live our lives and conduct our business, the government has a responsibility to enshrine codes of conduct, morality, standards of living, and provide for the basic needs of its citizens. By providing these essential goods and services, the government can ensure that every member of society has access to the necessary tools to lead a productive and fulfilling life.



For example, the concept of a "basic income" or "universal basic income" (UBI) is an idea that has gained traction in recent years. The idea behind a UBI is to provide all citizens with a guaranteed minimum income, regardless of their employment status or other factors. This would ensure that everyone has access to basic necessities, such as food, shelter, and healthcare.

Similarly, the concept of a "social safety net" refers to a set of programs and policies designed to help those who are most vulnerable in society, such as the elderly, disabled, and unemployed. These programs may include things like unemployment benefits, food assistance programs, and healthcare subsidies.

Privatisation of Public Services is not an option
Consider the role of Government.
Part of that role is as a guarantor of the standard by which we as citizens live our lives and conduct our business. Government enshrines, through legislation and judicial process, codes of conduct, morality, standards of living, etc.
This minimal guarantee is not just a promise regarding your life experience as an individual, but more a promise to the individuals you interact with in society. It is a guarantee that individuals you do business with will not drop dead mid-deal, that you aren't robbed at knifepoint, or that your carer will not be late to your home because of delayed transportation.
Explain the role of govnmt as a provider of minimum viable goods and services.
Through the provision of goods - water, food and infrastructure - a Government guarantees those you interact
In provision of these services, a Government typically guarantees each member of society an acceptable standard of:
Health
Mobility
Education
Communication
Behaviour
Morality

It is obvious that 
How private sector can bring efficiency
How private sector cannot guarantee consistency and quality
If you accept this concept of Government as an ensurer of MVGS, you give them a responsibility to guarantee these services and goods are available consistently, and to the necessary quality. The private sector offers efficiencies, but cannot guarantee quality and availability, and so in accepting Government's role as an ensurer of MVGS, you must too accept that it should be the supplier of these goods an services too.
