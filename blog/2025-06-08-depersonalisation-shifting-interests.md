When your interests and attention shift rapidly, it becomes hard to maintain a stable sense of self. Who are you if your passions change constantly?

## The pattern

One week it's this topic, next week it's that. Deep dives that last days or months, then evaporate. Projects started with enthusiasm, abandoned when something new catches your attention.

This can be productive. You learn broadly, make unexpected connections. But it has a cost.

## The identity question

We partly define ourselves through sustained interests. "I'm someone who cares about X." When X keeps changing, that foundation becomes unstable.

You end up feeling like a series of temporary selves rather than a continuous person.

## The social cost

Other people expect consistency. They remember what you were interested in last time. When you've moved on, there's a disconnect.

"Oh, you're not doing that anymore?" becomes a frequent question. It can feel like you're not allowed to change.

## Is this pathological?

Sometimes shifting attention indicates something (ADHD, for instance). Sometimes it's just a personality trait. Sometimes it's environmental, a response to abundance of options and information.

The question isn't whether it's normal. It's whether it's working for you.

## Living with it

Some approaches:
- Find threads that persist across shifting interests
- Let go of the need for a fixed identity
- Document where you've been so it doesn't feel lost
- Distinguish between surface interests and deeper values

The rapid shifting might be who you are. Learning to be okay with that is the task.
