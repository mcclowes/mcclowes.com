I use a continuous glucose monitor (Libre) and Shuggah app to manage my health. When they're unreliable, the anxiety is particular. Your lifeline becomes a source of stress.

## The dependency

When you rely on technology for health monitoring, you develop a relationship with it. You check it constantly. You trust its readings. You make decisions based on its data.

This is mostly good. Information enables better choices.

## When it fails

But the technology isn't perfect:
- Sensors give false readings
- Apps crash or lose data
- Bluetooth disconnects
- Sensors fall off or fail early

Each failure creates a gap in knowledge that feels dangerous.

## The meta-anxiety

It's not just the immediate concern ("what's my glucose right now?"). It's the anxiety about the system itself ("can I trust this?").

You're simultaneously dependent on the technology and aware of its unreliability. This is an uncomfortable combination.

## The broader pattern

This isn't unique to health tech. It applies anywhere technology becomes load-bearing:
- Work depending on reliable internet
- Communication depending on phones
- Navigation depending on GPS

When these fail, the anxiety isn't just about the moment. It's about the fragility of systems we've built our lives around.

## Living with uncertainty

There's no perfect solution. The technology helps more than it hurts. But accepting some level of uncertainty is necessary.

The alternative, complete self-reliance, isn't realistic. Neither is blind trust. What's left is an uncomfortable middle ground: use the tools, but stay aware of their limits.
