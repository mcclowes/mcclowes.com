              <p>
                I'm a product director with over a decade of experience building tools that work with the grain of people and systems. My background spans engineering, design, and strategy—shaping software that solves real problems, and quietly endures.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                I've led product in startups and scale-ups across SaaS and fintech, founded my own venture, and helped teams align on what matters. I think in systems, care about craft, and trust intuition sharpened by data. In 2017, I was awarded the Duke of York's Young Entrepreneur Award.

              <p>
                Outside of work, I write essays, compose music, and sketch. I'm interested in the emotional texture of tools, the aesthetics of decision-making, and how creative practice can inform the structures we build. This site is a place to explore that intersection.

              <p>I make things by feel.</p>
              
              <p>
                Whether I'm designing a product, writing a sentence, sketching a shape, or composing a sound, I start with instinct—something unresolved, a pull. I test, adjust, rework. Not chasing elegance, just trying to find what works—what lands, what moves, what matters.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                I think a lot about experience—not in the UX sense, but in the felt sense.<br />
                What does it feel like to use this? To read this? To be inside this?
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Play and practice are central to how I work. I'm not interested in perfection or polish for its own sake. I'd rather make, break, remake—see what happens, then make again. I trust the hand, the ear, the eye. I trust iteration more than theory.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Sometimes the work is useful. Sometimes it's just interesting. That's fine with me.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                This site is a record of things I've made—essays, sketches, systems, sounds.<br />
                Some finished. Most not. It's all part of the same practice: doing the thing, noticing what happens, doing it again.
