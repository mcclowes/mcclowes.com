![Tiles](/img/posts/tiles/tiles.png)

I’m a product director with over a decade of experience building tools that work with the grain of people and systems. My background spans engineering, design, and strategy—shaping software that solves real problems, and quietly endures.

I’ve led product in startups and scale-ups across SaaS and fintech, founded my own venture, and helped teams align on what matters. I think in systems, care about craft, and trust intuition sharpened by data.

Outside of work, I write essays, compose music, and sketch. I'm interested in the emotional texture of tools, the aesthetics of decision-making, and how creative practice can inform the structures we build. This site is a place to explore that intersection.

## Philosophy of Practice

I make things by feel.

Whether I’m designing a product, writing a sentence, sketching a shape, or composing a sound, I start with instinct—something unresolved, a pull. I test, adjust, rework. Not chasing elegance, just trying to find what works—what lands, what moves, what matters.

I think a lot about experience—not in the UX sense, but in the felt sense.
What does it feel like to use this? To read this? To be inside this?

Play and practice are central to how I work. I’m not interested in perfection or polish for its own sake. I’d rather make, break, remake—see what happens, then make again. I trust the hand, the ear, the eye. I trust iteration more than theory.

Sometimes the work is useful. Sometimes it’s just interesting. That’s fine with me.

This site is a record of things I’ve made—essays, sketches, systems, sounds.
Some finished. Most not. It’s all part of the same practice: doing the thing, noticing what happens, doing it again.
