# The 5Ds of product management

Every PM should have an angle—a specific area of depth that makes them genuinely useful.

---

## The framework

<div className="framework-grid">

### Design

Can shape user experience, run research, translate insights into interfaces.

**Signals:** Portfolio includes UX work, conducts user interviews, thinks in journeys and wireframes.

### Development

Understands technical constraints, collaborates deeply with engineers, knows what's actually hard.

**Signals:** Can read code, discusses architecture trade-offs, engineers want to work with them.

### Delivery

Masters of getting things out the door, managing scope, unblocking teams.

**Signals:** Ships consistently, manages stakeholders well, keeps teams focused and moving.

### Domain

Deep expertise in a specific vertical—fintech, health, logistics, etc.

**Signals:** Speaks the language of the industry, understands regulations, has relevant network.

### Data

Can define metrics, run experiments, make decisions grounded in evidence.

**Signals:** Comfortable with SQL, designs experiments, challenges assumptions with data.

## How to use it

**For hiring:** Know your team's gaps first. A technical team needs Design or Domain. A team struggling to ship needs Delivery. A team shipping fast but not learning needs Data.

**For self-assessment:** Be honest about your one or two genuine strengths. You don't need all five—you need to know which ones you bring.

**For team building:** Map your team's collective 5Ds coverage. Hire to fill gaps, not to duplicate existing strengths.
