# The 4Ps of good business

Each P needs to be in place, in order, or you're doomed.

---

## The framework

<div className="framework-grid framework-numbered">

### 1. Purpose

The gravitational pull at the center of everything you do. Not just your mission statement—the quiet whisper guiding your hardest choices.

**Questions to ask:**
- Why does this business exist beyond making money?
- What would be lost if we disappeared?
- Does this purpose hold steady in uncertainty?

### 2. People

Not resources—partners, collaborators, and co-creators of your vision. Greatness emerges when people feel safe to explore, fail, and flourish.

**Questions to ask:**
- Do people feel safe to take risks here?
- Are relationships built on genuine trust?
- Is humanity at the heart of how we work?

### 3. Process

The invisible infrastructure that turns ideals into outcomes. Neither bureaucracy nor checklist—the deliberate pursuit of doing things intentionally and sustainably.

**Questions to ask:**
- Do our processes enable or constrain creativity?
- Are we doing things intentionally or by habit?
- Can teams innovate within our structures?

### 4. Product

Your promise made tangible. Not just what you sell—the expression of everything you believe in and represent.

**Questions to ask:**
- Does our product align with our purpose?
- Does it respect all the people involved?
- Does it leave the world slightly better?

## How to use it

**Diagnosis:** When something feels off, work through the Ps in order. Problems at lower levels (Purpose, People) will manifest as symptoms at higher levels (Process, Product).

**Building:** Start with Purpose. Get that right before hiring. Get People right before formalizing Process. Get Process right before scaling Product.

**Assessment:** Score each P 1-5. The lowest score is your constraint—fix it before optimizing others.
