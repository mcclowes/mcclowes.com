## Agenda

### Part 1: Introduction (10 min)

1. Introduce the 5Ds framework:
   - **Design** — UX, research, interfaces
   - **Development** — Technical depth, engineering collaboration
   - **Delivery** — Shipping, scope management, unblocking
   - **Domain** — Vertical expertise
   - **Data** — Metrics, experiments, evidence-based decisions

2. Key insight: Most PMs claim all five. They're not. That's fine.

### Part 2: Individual assessment (15 min)

Each participant rates themselves 1-5 on each D:

- **1** = Aware of it, not a strength
- **2** = Can do it when needed
- **3** = Competent, reliable
- **4** = Strong, go-to person
- **5** = Expert, could teach others

Write scores privately first, then share.

### Part 3: Team mapping (20 min)

1. Create a 5x5 grid (5Ds on Y-axis, team members on X-axis)
2. Plot everyone's self-assessment scores
3. Calculate column totals for each D
4. Identify:
   - **Strong areas** (total > 12)
   - **Gaps** (total < 8)
   - **Dependencies** (single person scores > 4)

### Part 4: Gap analysis (15 min)

Discuss as a group:

1. Which gaps hurt us most right now?
2. Which will hurt us in 6 months?
3. For each gap:
   - Can we develop internally?
   - Do we need to hire?
   - Can we restructure to cover?

### Part 5: Action planning (15 min)

Create concrete actions:

| Gap          | Action                        | Owner  | Timeline |
| ------------ | ----------------------------- | ------ | -------- |
| e.g., Data   | Hire analytics-focused PM     | [Name] | Q2       |
| e.g., Domain | Partner with industry advisor | [Name] | Q1       |

## Facilitation tips

- **Psychological safety first.** Emphasize that gaps are team gaps, not personal failures.
- **Watch for over-rating.** If everyone is 4-5 on everything, push back gently.
- **Consider context.** A team's needs change with stage and strategy.
- **Capture the map.** Photo or export the grid—it's useful for future hiring.

## Variations

### Hiring panel version (45 min)

Focus only on Parts 1 and 3-4. Map current team, identify the gap you're hiring for, then score candidates against that specific D.

### 1:1 coaching version (30 min)

Skip Part 3. Focus on individual self-assessment, honest reflection on their 1-2 genuine strengths, and development plan for one growth area.

### Leadership offsite version (2 hours)

Extend Part 4 to include org-wide PM function analysis. Map all PMs, identify systemic gaps, plan hiring and development at scale.
