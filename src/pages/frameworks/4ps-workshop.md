## Agenda

### Part 1: Introduction (10 min)

1. Introduce the 4Ps framework in order:
   - **Purpose** — Why you exist beyond money
   - **People** — Partners and collaborators, not resources
   - **Process** — Invisible infrastructure for outcomes
   - **Product** — Your promise made tangible

2. Key insight: Problems at lower levels manifest as symptoms at higher levels. Fix in order.

### Part 2: Individual scoring (20 min)

Each participant scores each P from 1-5 anonymously:

- **1** = Broken, actively causing harm
- **2** = Weak, frequent problems
- **3** = Functional, occasional issues
- **4** = Strong, working well
- **5** = Excellent, a genuine strength

**Scoring prompts:**

#### Purpose

- Can everyone articulate why we exist?
- Does our purpose guide hard decisions?
- Would anyone notice if we disappeared?

#### People

- Do people feel safe to take risks?
- Are relationships built on genuine trust?
- Do we treat people as partners or resources?

#### Process

- Do our processes enable or constrain creativity?
- Are we intentional or just habitual?
- Can teams innovate within our structures?

#### Product

- Does our product align with our purpose?
- Does it respect all the people involved?
- Does it leave the world slightly better?

### Part 3: Reveal and discuss (25 min)

1. Reveal all scores anonymously (sticky notes on wall or digital poll)
2. Calculate averages for each P
3. Note the spread—large disagreements are signals
4. Discuss:
   - Where do we agree? Disagree?
   - What's driving the lowest-scored P?
   - Are we treating symptoms (Product/Process) instead of causes (People/Purpose)?

### Part 4: Constraint identification (20 min)

The 4Ps work in sequence. Your constraint is your lowest-scored P.

**Discussion questions:**

1. What specific evidence supports this low score?
2. How does this constraint show up day-to-day?
3. What have we tried before? Why didn't it work?
4. What would a "3" look like? A "4"?

### Part 5: Action planning (20 min)

Focus ONLY on the constraint. Improving higher Ps without fixing lower ones is wasted effort.

| Observation                        | Action                       | Owner  | Check-in |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------ | -------- |
| e.g., Purpose unclear to new hires | Write and share purpose doc  | [Name] | 2 weeks  |
| e.g., People don't feel safe       | Anonymous feedback mechanism | [Name] | 1 week   |

Limit to 2-3 actions. Do less, better.

### Part 6: Close (10 min)

1. Summarize the constraint and actions
2. Schedule follow-up session (4-6 weeks)
3. Commit to re-scoring at follow-up

## Facilitation tips

- **Anonymity matters.** People won't score honestly if scores are public.
- **Resist jumping to Product.** It's the most visible P but rarely the root cause.
- **Watch for defensiveness.** Low scores on Purpose or People can feel personal to founders.
- **Embrace disagreement.** Score spread reveals where alignment is needed.

---

## Variations

### Quick diagnostic (30 min)

Skip Parts 2-3 detail. Do a quick group scoring (thumbs up/down/sideways for each P), identify the obvious constraint, and spend remaining time on Part 5.

### Deep dive (half-day)

Extend Part 3 to include sub-dimensions. For each P, identify 3-4 specific aspects and score each separately. More granular diagnosis, more targeted actions.

### Board/investor version (60 min)

Focus on Purpose and People. These are the foundations that boards/investors often overlook. Use Product discussion only to illustrate how Purpose/People issues manifest.
