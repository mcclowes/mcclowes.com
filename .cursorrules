# Blog Post Style and Grammar Rules

## Title and Header Formatting
- Use **sentence casing** for all titles and headers (capitalize only the first word and proper nouns)
- Examples:
  - ✅ "The 4 Ps of good business"
  - ✅ "Deleting social media"
  - ✅ "Perplexity vs. Google for search"
  - ❌ "The 4 Ps of Good Business"
  - ❌ "Deleting Social Media"

## Oxford Comma Usage
- **Always use Oxford commas** (serial commas) in lists of three or more items
- Examples:
  - ✅ "I've deleted my Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram accounts."
  - ✅ "Purpose, people, process, and product are the four pillars."
  - ❌ "I've deleted my Facebook, Twitter and Instagram accounts."
  - ❌ "Purpose, people, process and product are the four pillars."
